# Collinear-Points
Given a set of n distinct points in the plane, find every (maximal) line segment that connects a subset of 4 or more of the points
and there is two ways to do that:
## First way(the slowest one)
examines 4 points at a time and checks whether they all lie on the same line segment, returning all such line segments. To check whether the 4 points p, q, r, and s are collinear, check whether the three slopes between p and q, between p and r, and between p and s are all equal,
it takes time propotional to n^4, and that's the BruteCollinearPoints class does
## Second way(the faster one)
A faster, sorting-based solution. Remarkably, it is possible to solve the problem much faster than the brute-force solution described above. Given a point p, the following method determines whether p participates in a set of 4 or more collinear points.
- Think of p as the origin.
- For each other point q, determine the slope it makes with p.
- Sort the points according to the slopes they makes with p. -Check if any 3 (or more) adjacent points in the sorted order have equal slopes with respect to p. If so, these points, together with p, are collinear.
it takes time proprtional to n^2 log n, as the mergeSort takes n log n, and the loop takes n
